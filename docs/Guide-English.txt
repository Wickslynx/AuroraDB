    save: This function reads the contents of the unordered map and saves it into a file.
    connect: This function opens a server to handle different requests.

    set: This function adds a user to the unordered map if the user does not already exist.
    get: This function retrieves a user's password from the database.
    remove: This function locates and removes a user from the database.
